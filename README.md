======================

Prediction Market demo using Hanson's Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)

[Go To Demo](http://cdetrio.github.io/prediction-market-lmsr/index.html)

TODOS:
  - Form for creating markets. Specify number of outcomes N, names of outcomes, and B vector (initial liquidity and probabilities)
  - Sell an outcome (equivalent to buying a fraction of a share each on the other outcomes)
  - Scaled outcomes (continuous value, rather than discrete)
  - Volume-parameterized market maker (aka liquidity-sensitive. B increases with trading volume)
